<body><h1>Mahaprasad
    <h2>Mahaprasad (Odia: ମହାପ୍ରସାଦ) is the term applied to the 56 food items offered to Lord Jagannath in the holy Temple of Puri, located in Odisha, India. The Bhog/Naivedya offered to him and later to Maa Bimala in the Grand Temple (Sri Mandir) and remains of that Nivedana (after accepting by the God) is known as ‘Mahaprasad’. Mahaprasad is also widely named as the famous Chappan Bhog.
    <p>Mahaprasad is of two types. One is Sankudi mahaprasad and the other is Sukhila mahaprasad. Both the types are available for sale in Ananda Bazaar of the Grand Temple.

    <p><h1>Steps:</h1>>        
        <ol><li>The ingredients used for preparing Mahaprasad are sourced locally and are of the highest quality. Rice, lentils, vegetables, spices, ghee (clarified butter), sugar, and other essential items are procured.
            <p><li>Cooking in Traditional Earthen Pots: The cooking process takes place in the temple kitchen, known as the "Roshaghara."
                <p></p><li>The food is cooked in traditional earthen pots over a wood fire. This ancient method is believed to enhance the taste and spiritual purity of the food. The pots are kept one on top of the other loaded with the ingredients ie on multiple tiers of around seven. Miraculously the pot on top is cooked first progressing to the bottom one.
                    <p></p><li>Devotional Cooking: The cooking is done by a select group of temple cooks known as "Mahasuara" or "Suara Mahasay." They are traditionally the cooks of the temple, who have inherited the cooking skills and techniques from their ancestors. The cooking process is conducted with utmost devotion and adherence to the prescribed rituals.
                        <p></p><li>trict Dietary Regulations: The temple follows strict dietary regulations called "Mahaprasad Niyam." Certain items like onion, garlic, and certain spices are not used in the preparation of Mahaprasad. The food is prepared with pure vegetarian ingredients ie Satvik.
                            <p></p><li>Lord Jagannath's Offering: During the cooking process, a portion of the food is set aside as an offering to Lord Jagannath. It is believed that Lord Jagannath himself tastes and blesses the food before it becomes Mahaprasad.
